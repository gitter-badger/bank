This is a project to build out modern banking infrastructure from best principles using Golang. The end goal is to have a fully functional bank, including implementation of [ISO20022](http://www.iso20022.org) standards, across:

- Payments
- Securities
- Trade Services
- FX
- Cards

Some other major goals include:

- Using a distributed database
- Regulations built in (Basel III, etc)

I am also [writing about the development](http://blog.ksred.me/tags/banking-infrastructure/) of this project.
